*ASTRO-WEIGHT-CALCULATOR*

Introduction

Welcome to your first JavaScript project!
Consider a scenario where you've been hired by NASA to build an internal tool. Their engineers would like a way to calculate the weight of their various instruments on different planets in our solar system.
This information will be used by the engineers to plan out how much equipment can be transported while still being able to depart the destination planet.
